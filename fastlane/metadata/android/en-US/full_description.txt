Kai is designed to provide you with access to powerful, state-of-the-art conversational AI models. Through a simple and intuitive chat interface, you can engage with models like Llama and Google's Gemini, exploring their capabilities for various tasks. Whether you need help brainstorming, summarizing, writing, learning, or just want to have an engaging conversation, Chat AI provides a versatile platform.

**Important Note:** This application requires an internet connection, as all requests are processed on a remote server. Please be aware that using these cloud-based models involves sending your inputs to a remote server. This may have some privacy considerations, so be mindful of the information you provide to the AI. While the app itself does not store chat history, and user inputs are sent to the models for processing, no data or user IDs are stored by the application.
